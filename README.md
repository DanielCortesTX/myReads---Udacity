# MyReads Project

* This project was created for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. Assets for the layout and styling were provided. The project was meant to test React fundamentals including state management, component usage, props usage and more.

* This application is the result of cloning the starter code provided for the project and adding the requisite functionality.

* Starter code provides an api that handles the database for books used in app.

* The app.js file runs the application and has routes for a Main page and Search Page.

* The main page handles books that have been selected for shelves. The books can be moved by clicking on the drop down on their bottom right corner.

* On the search page, typing into the unput field will make a search of the API based on whether the input matches any key search words. Errors and an empty search bar wield appropriate results.
